Local Organizing Committee (LOC) The LOC is normally composed of staff from hosting institutes \u2013 but this is not hard and fast. If the LOC needs outside expertise, a PCO for example, it should get it on board early on. The person responsible for the Scientific Secretariat is also a member of the LOC. The LOC meets as many times as necessary, the meetings becoming more frequent and targeting more specific issues as the conference approaches. The LOC takes the responsibility for organizing the event at the local level, based on the decisions of the IEC/SPC. More and more frequently Professional Conference Organizers (PCOs) are being hired to take responsibility for registration, accommodation, the organization of the industrial exhibition, together with the Industrial Exhibition Manager who is a LOC member, space management, the organization of social events, etc. They are members of the LOC. Note that contracting a PCO to organize various portions of the conference does not mean complete outsourcing. The control over PCO activities should always remain with the LOC. Scientific Secretariat (SS) The job description of the Scientific Secretariat can vary nowadays depending on the conference, the region, the staffing possibilities. The SS is composed of at least one person who is responsible for the tasks listed below, and who often joins forces with at least one person with the responsibility for the IT side of the production of the proceedings (organizing the IT, the computers and printers set up and installed with appropriate software), and often a further person running various scripts during the conference, as well as the final JACoW publication scripts package. The SS is responsible for all of the texts published at the conference website relating to author information and the scientific programme. The SS is normally the Administrator of the SPMS or Indico, ensuring that the system parameters reflect the different activities in the life of the organization of the conference, assigning the different privileges to the people responsible for the various activities. The SS is the interface between the conference, the scientific programme organization and the contributors/delegates. The SS is responsible for setting up and organizing the JACoW team ready for on-line processing of contributions to the proceedings during the conference, generally with an IT Manager, and for the publication of the proceedings at the JACoW site as soon after the conference as possible. \u201cScientific Secretariat\u201d may not be the best term, but the jobs described in these paragraphs do result in a more than full time activity at least during the year leading up to the conference. Scientific Programme Coordinator, could be a possible title for the person carrying out all of the above. The title \"Editor (in Chief)\" should be reserved for the person with responsibility for the publication of the proceedings, if that person is different from the SS. Editorial Board (EB) Since the outset of electronic publication in JACoW, the SS worked together with some more technical people (IT, scripting, etc.) to produce the proceedings. This small group collaborated early on at the planning stage to ensure that the relatively complex hard- and software, server and networking requirements were met for pre- conference, conference and post-conference activities. The group came to be called an Editorial Board (EB) and today it is usually composed of: the SS responsible for the interface with contributors through Indico and veracity of the metadata (table of contents, author index, wrappers) IT Manager (soft- and hardware, webserver, file server, networking, setting up of all computers, printers, etc.) the SPC and LOC Chairs (respectively for scientific content and for budget) the person who runs the scripts to pull the final proceedings together, if different from the SS/IT Manager. The EB does not meet. The SS is the Chair of the EB. JACoW FEL is a member of the Joint Accelerator Conferences Website (JACoW) Collaboration. JACoW is an international collaboration in electronic publication of accelerator conference proceedings. Organization, membership conditions and requirements are set out in detail in a Charter published at the JACoW.org website. Requests to join the Collaboration are approved by the Board of Directors. Membership is conditional on a commitment from each series to publish at least three sets of proceedings at the site and send their Editors (past, current and future) to the annual JACoW Team Meetings. The persons or EBs with the responsibility for the publication of proceedings, sometimes known as \"editors\", of the past, current and future conferences in each series, members of the JACoW Collaboration, form the JACoW Team. Team members new to electronic publication can take advantage of introductory \"hands on\" training in basic processing techniques during major JACoW events (IPAC, NA-PAC, LINAC, FEL, ICALEPCS, etc.). Conference editors with little experience can also call on help from JACoW\u2019s experts, normally by inviting them on to a guest editorial team during the conferences, on the condition that their local expenses are covered. Each conference series is encouraged to build in a certain amount of continuity via the editors, inviting past and future editors as \u201cguest editors\u201d at each event. More importantly, collaborating conference series undertake to send their Team members (Editors of the past, current and future event in each series), to the Team Meetings organized around the end of each year, rotating around Asia, Europe and the US. Conferences should include an item in the conference budget to cover this. Team Meetings provide the opportunity for members of the Collaboration to pursue in greater depth all issues related to electronic publication, as well as the development of tools such as the Scientific Programme Management System (SPMS), Indico and the scripts which pull all of the individual files of contributions together into the final publication package. Professional electronic publication is not trivial, it cannot be improvised, and to publish according to JACoW's high standards implies that Team members receive adequate training, but also once their expertise is acquired, that they remain members of the Team for a certain period in order to take part in the training of novice editors. Since JACoW is based on good will, attendance at Team Meetings and participation in JACoW activities is essential to maintain high standards and continuity and to the success of the entire venture.

This person is also normally the JACoW Team Member, or an Associate Team Member and contact person for JACoW Management, with the responsibility to check documentation relating to the event published on jacow.org, for example concerning the conference, its venue and dates, the names of OC/SPC/LOC Chairs, Stakeholders, etc. The Admin privileges upon delivery of the JACoW- Indico event will also be assigned to several JACoW Experts, usually the JACoW Events Manager, the JACoW Chair and the Coordinator. Depending on the event, some other persons may also be assigned Admin privileges. Note that a major difference working with Indico is that contributions to the proceedings will be uploaded to Indico, and no longer to the JACoW paper servers at PSI and JLab. JACoW-Indico events are linked to the JACoW SPMS Central Repository of Profiles and Affiliations. Delivery of a JACoW-Indico Event The Event Administrator receives a link to their event: https://indico.jacow.org/e/<ConfName> This is the \"display view\". The main pane contains the basic information provided to the JACoW Events Manager, for example, the name of the event and the start and end dates. The Overview pane on the left hand side shows the areas of the event open to the person logging in. This area will change as new permissions are added or removed. The pen icon in the top grey bar leads to the Management Area for the event: The pane on the left has a number of different links: Settings, Timetable, Protection, Organization, Workflows, Reports, Customization and Advanced Options. The Event Administrator will organize the event via these links. This document explains the activities behind the links in the Management Area.

The Manage Contributions link leads to the \"Contributions\" screen under Organization, and explained below. This screen allows for the creation of \"contributions\" outside of normal abstract submission. Note that Indico distinguishes between \" abstracts \", which are proposals for contributions to the conference submitted during the call for abstracts exercise(s), and \" contributions \" which are entries solicited by the SPC, or entered by the Administrator, that will already have been accepted for presentation by the SPC without going via a review procedure (see Glossary ). Thus, creating entries for talks, posters etc., may be carried out in two ways: via the \"usual\" call for abstracts which will appear in the display area mentioned above when abstract submission is open, or via the \"Manage Contributions\" link shown above when a \"contribution\" is created, i.e. a talk or poster already accepted for presentation, with no need to go through a selection procedure. Timetable The Timetable screen is used to enter the conference daily schedule: Via the links to Add new Session block/Contribution/Break the Event Administrator will build the event schedule. Protection The event protection screen controls permissions/privileges to either \"Manage\" or \"Access\", parts of the event. When creating the event the JACoW Events Manager will have assigned the Event Administrator with full Admin permissions or privileges, together with other JACoW Experts. Event protection Permissions are set via this screen. Clicking on Add \"User / Group\" or \"Event Role\" opens new windows. Choosing between \"Users\" and \"Groups\" opens the possibility to enter: Users : search for new Users, or choose from the \"Suggested Users\" proposed (and based on the Event Admin privileges) to enter individuals and enter Manage or Access permissions; Groups : create Group names, and either search for new Users, or choose from the \"Suggested Users\" proposed (and based on the Event Admin permissions) to enter individuals. Groups are instance-wide (indico.jacow.org), roles are event-only \"groups\". It is also possible to assign permissions to roles that will have been entered in the Roles Setup screen described below. Manage/Access permissions are thus assigned to the different roles/users/groups. There are three Protection modes for the event: Public : Publicly accessible since it is set as \"open\" to the public, Inheriting : accessible depending on the event category Protected : Only accessible by the users specified above and the managers of parent resources. We suggest that the event be set as Protected until the general submission for contributed presentations opens. For this to work, be sure that all people that needs access to this event is listed in the Protection section above. It is wise to define all Roles and add Roles under Protection instead of single individuals. The Access key should not be used for security reasons. The No access contact may be used to enter contact information when a person without permissions is trying to access the event. The Visibility options make the event visible or invisible in the list of events in one or more categories when browsing indico.JACoW.org .

They represent both the basis for the Scientific Programme and a taxonomy that can be used to classify submissions during the Call for Abstracts process. Many JACoW accelerator conferences have adopted a combination of Main plus Sub-classifications to enable a finer tuning of content, facilitating the scheduling of posters across numerous sessions and days. For example, the Sub-classification/Track \"novel concepts\" may at an Accelerator conference be tied to several different Main Classifications/Track Groups, i.e. novel concepts in Circular Colliders, novel concepts in Light Sources. The SPMS functionality allowed for the submitting author to first select a Main Classification, which opened up a sub-list of Sub-classifications. In JACoW-Indico the Programme screen is used to enter Track Groups with the associated Tracks, but upon abstract submission it is not possible to separate the Track Groups, all Track Groups and all Tracks are therefore visible to authors. The Track Groups and Tracks entered in this screen appear in the Display View of the Scientific Programme. Registration This screen customizes the registration procedure. Registration managers and staff with corresponding privileges are entered, the participant list is defined and registration forms are created.

Overview of the process As soon as the Abstract Initial QA is complete the Administrator sets up for the SPC to: a) Verify all Tracks are correct/Propose Track changes b) Accept/reject proposals for Track changes c) Prioritize invited oral proposals d) Accept/Reject proposals for invited orals The setting up for the above will necessarily be in several distinct steps with careful attention to permissions and deadlines: because in order for all SPC members to see all proposals (both for Tracks and Prioritization) they must all have Review privilege on all abstracts submitted. MC Coordinators will have Convene permissions which include the possibility to actually change the Track for the abstracts. SPC members must therefore be warned to limit themselves to proposing Track changes and comments; because currently the two activities, a) and c) are grouped in the same screen and it would be possible for SPC members to return to Track changes when that exercise is normally closed. The process we will follow is: All SPC members are given Review permission on all Tracks, with a deadline to verify the tracks are correct and to propose changes where necessary. After the deadline this permission is revoked so no other changes will be possible during the following step. MC Coordinators ( Track Conveners ) are assigned Convene permissions in their designated Tracks and are invited to \"edit\" the proposals for Track changes and eventually change track for the given abstract. The Administrator then prepares the Prioritization as described further on. All SPC members are again given Review privilege to prioritize proposals for invited orals. During the SPC/2 meeting, and following discussion, Conveners are assigned Judging permissions to accept/reject proposals for invited orals, which then automatically become contributions which can be scheduled. 1. Assign Review permission to the SPC Assigning the privileges/permissions to SPC members and Conveners for the above tasks is done via the Workflows > Call for Abstracts > Reviewing screen which controls the roles with permissions to review, the settings, and questions: For IPAC, the SPC is normally divided into small working groups composed of a Track Group Coordinator per Track Group (Main Classification) from the hosting region, and a Co-Coordinator from one of the other regions. In some instances, extra persons are added. Prior therefore to assigning permissions, the Roles of SPC Member , and Track Group Coordinator/Convener/Judge and the relevant persons for each of the Tracks need to be set up in the Organization / Roles setup screen. The Coordinators/Conveners might be called MC1 Convener , MC2 Convener , MC3 Convener etc. for example. Behind each Role, the names of the persons should have been entered: To set permissions, go to Workflows > Call for Abstracts > Reviewing > Roles . At the top of the page, under All Tracks , click on Event Role and enter the role of SPC Member: Once the role of SPC Members has been entered, the screen shows this: Then for each Track enter the role of the corresponding Coordinator/Convener, and click on the \" + \" to the right to add Convene : When all Conveners have been entered the screen looks like this: General settings It also is necessary to check the Workflows > Call for Abstracts > Reviewing > Settings , in particular: Allow track conveners to judge : for this exercise it should be disabled ; Allow conveners to change tracks : for this exercise it should be disabled ; Allow comments : for this exercise it should be enabled ; Allow contributors in comments : for this exercise it should be disabled ; Reviewing Instructions : put here a summary of the instructions the SPC will go through. Notes on permissions With the above setup the SPC members will be able to only read comments left with visibility set \" To reviewers, conveners and judges \". If you want that these people will also be able to read comments left with visibility set \" To conveners and judges \", plus all the reviews left so far (i.e., proposals for track changes only, per instructions), then it will be needed to give \" Convene \" permissions to SPC as well. In this case, be sure that the settings \" Allow track conveners to judge \" and \" Allow conveners to change tracks \" are NOT set in the Workflow / Call for Abstracts / Settings pane. Call for the SPC review Now it's the time to inform the SPC members about what they're asked to do and how. The Scientific Secretariat will go to the Roles Setup or Participant Roles screens and send an email to the SPC in a similar way of that of the Call for Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations . We suggest that this email includes a link to the detailed instructions for this particular job of the SPC . This activity should last one/two weeks , a deadline needs to be given accordingly. 2. MC Coordinators review Track changes proposals First action to do after the deadline for submission of proposals for invited oral presentations is to remove Review permissions to the SPC. This way the MC conveners will be able to work through the next phase without fear of having new reviews coming in. To do so, refer to the instructions above and click on the \" X \" sign in the Review orange button for the Scientific Programme Committee member. After this action the MC Coordinators will still have Convener permissions on their assigned MC/Track - it may be wise to also give them Review permissions on all tracks so that they can access all abstracts. Next, go to Workflows > Call for Abstracts > Reviewing > Settings and enable the \" Allow conveners to change tracks \". Remember to save the change. Call for the MC Coordinators review As usal, it's time now to notify the MC Coordinators to review the track changes requests. With the email utility of your choice in the Roles Setup or Participant Roles screens, the Scientific Secretariat will send instructions to the Track Conveners, together with a clear deadline. This exercise should last one/two weeks . 3. Preparation for the Prioritization of proposed abstracts The next task is to reconfigure the abstract reviewing interface via the Workflows > Call for Abstracts > Settings pane: Work through the various issues: Allow track conveners to judge : keep this disabled until the next step in the workflow Allow conveners to change tracks : disable this to avoid MC Coordinators to make any changes that should have already been performed in the previous step - you can enable it at any time upon special requests Reviewing Instructions : you may want to modify the text to now give the SPC detailed instructions about the scores to be given to the proposals Judgment Instructions : put here the instructions for the MC Coordinators on how to accept (or not) the proposals and turn them into contributions To be able to enter a priority for consideration of invited oral presentations, it is necessary to configure abstract reviewing questions via the Workflows > Call for Abstracts > Reviewing > Questions interface: Note that the Questions interface should only be completed when the prioritization begins. It is better to enable this second activity only after the Track change proposals are complete. For this exercise we are adding a question of type Yes/No : Normally IPAC conferences use two questions of type Yes/No: First priority Second priority Any SPC member is asked to select a number of abstracts (general rule of thumb: 5 per MC) to be proposed as invited oral presentations: for those abstracts this person will set question \"First priority\" to Yes . It is not really needed to strike a No for the non-selected abstracts: this question can be left unanswered. Same process will be used for a number of abstracts to be proposed as second priority (second choice). 4. Set Review privilege to all SPC members Similarly to what done in the first step of this process , the SPC members need to have assigned Review privilege again. MC Coordinators (Conveners) should still have Convene privilege from the start, which won't change. Call for the prioritization exercise With the above in place, a mail may be sent to the SPC providing instructions which should guide members through this tasks with appropriate warnings, together with a clear deadline. This exercise should last two/three weeks . 5. Accept/Reject proposals by MC Coordinators during SPC/2 When the prioritization exercise is over it is necessary to give Judgement power to the MC Coordinators ( Conveners ). This can be done by getting back to the Workflows > Call for Abstracts > Settings pane and enabling the Allow track conveners to judge setting. This will enable MC Coordinators to actually accept the wanted proposals.

MC Coordinators will have Convene permissions which include the possibility to actually change the Track for the abstracts. SPC members must therefore be warned to limit themselves to proposing Track changes and comments; because currently the two activities, a) and c) are grouped in the same screen and it would be possible for SPC members to return to Track changes when that exercise is normally closed. The process we will follow is: All SPC members are given Review permission on all Tracks, with a deadline to verify the tracks are correct and to propose changes where necessary. After the deadline this permission is revoked so no other changes will be possible during the following step. MC Coordinators ( Track Conveners ) are assigned Convene permissions in their designated Tracks and are invited to \"edit\" the proposals for Track changes and eventually change track for the given abstract. The Administrator then prepares the Prioritization as described further on. All SPC members are again given Review privilege to prioritize proposals for invited orals.

They will have slotted the invited oral presentations decided at the meeting into invited oral sessions with talks and speakers, and will also have decided the future contributed oral and poster sessions to be populated later. What are programme codes Most JACoW conferences have protocols in place to identify contributions by a programme code formed of several elements. For IPAC it looks like this: Date of Presentation ( MO , TU , etc.) Type of Presentation X for invited oral presentation sessions before morning coffee Y for invited oral presentation sessions after morning coffee Z for invited oral presentation sessions in the afternoon When there are several invited oral presentation sessions in different Track Groups/Main Classifications scheduled within a block (before or after coffee, in the afternoon), use XA , XB to distinguish. O for contributed oral (which becomes OA , OB , OC if there are several contributed oral sessions during the day) P for poster A code indicating where the session will take place, A for Auditorium A, B for Auditorium B, etc., or an indication of a poster session room or area A digit indicating the place within the session (001, 002, 003, etc.) Programme codes are used as a unique identifier for a contribution scheduled in the scientific programme. The programme code has until now been used to: to provide when/what/where information to name the files uploaded for contributions to the proceedings for assigning DOIs Creating Sessions In preparation for entering programme codes in the individual contributions, the Admin will: create a Spreadsheet showing the conference programme overview of all Sessions and talks, with session and programme codes. Ensure this is correct with the SPC Chair prior to entering the programme codes since it is complicated to move contributions around once they have been scheduled. Giving detailed instructions on how to manage such a spreadsheet is out of the scopes of this manual create Session Types, Sessions and Session Blocks in the Management Area. Session Types In one conference there may exist several different types of session, like: Opening, Closing, Special Remarks Invited Oral Presentations Contributed Oral Presentations Posters Special Student Posters Awards ... To better classify the sessions for the conference we need to create the set of all Session Types. To do so go to Organisation > Sessions , then open the Settings popup to the right of the \" Sessions \" header. By clicking on \" Session types \" it's possible to manage existing sessions or to create new ones by way of the \" + New session type \" blue button: The only mandatory field here is the name of this session type. Be sure, however, to switch on the Poster flag where appropriate. Sessions A Session is a group for contributions with some attributes, like the default duration of a contribution, a type of contributions and a location. This means that you cannot mix contributions of different type (e.g., Invited Orals and Posters) in one session. To create sessions for the conference go to the screen Organisation > Sessions and click on \" Add new session \". This screen has a required field for the title, and a default contribution duration. While none of the other fields are required (session code, description, type of session, location, colour), the Session code field will identify the session in the Book of Abstracts . Therefore, check the default contribution duration is correct , ensure the type of session/presentation is correct , and add a location by de-selecting \"Use default\" and entering a location. Continue creating the sessions for the whole conference. Hint : Enter the session code before the title of the session in the title field, because the session code is not included in the session information when scheduling sessions into the session blocks. It will be easier to identify a session code rather than the title or description of the session when there may be several sessions with the same title (invited oral presentations in MC1... when there are several sessions devoted to invited orals in MC1 during the conference). The sessions screen as it is populated will look like as shown below. Note the title column below begins with the session code (as hinted above) which will later therefore be visible in the Timetable when inserting talks into sessions as shown further below): The Block column above will show Session blocks \"0\" as long as the session has not been scheduled. Session blocks As seen above, a session in Indico lacks any information about \"when\" it will happen. For this you need to create a Session Block. A Session Block is (one part of) a session with a date, a starting time and a duration, plus optional Conveners (chairpersons), a (possibly different) location and programme code. Indico then permits to split one session into multiple blocks: the result is that it is possible to have different times and/or locations for a session. Normally this is never the case for JACoW conferences , hence we here assume a relationship 1 to 1 between sessions and blocks . For this reason one Session Block's Programme Code will be identical to its Session Code. To create \"Blocks\" you need to go to the Timetable screen. Select the wanted day and click on \" Add new \"... \" Session block \" to add the blocks and insert the Sessions from those previously created. Below you can see the session code entered in the session title field to facilitate identification: You don't need to give a name to the Session Block, even more for the reason that one session will have only one block, as explained above. However, we suggest that you fill in the Programme Code field when creating new blocks. Insert the corresponding Session Code : this will come useful when assigning Programme Codes to contributions. Please note that It is also possible to create Session Blocks and Sessions via this interface. To do so, click on Add new > Session block >Create a new session . The final result is visible in the Timetable: Scheduling contributions in the Timetable To create the Scientific Programme in Indico means scheduling presentations in the Timetable. To do so it is necessary to go through two steps: Assigning contributions to Sessions Scheduling a contribution from a Session into a Session Block Assigning contributions to sessions So far we have gone through the concept of Tracks, which are the scientific classification of the works. One track can then be implemented into one or more sessions. Normally, for IPACs, we keep a simple assignment of one Session (Block) per Track/Classification, but this may change whenever the organisers think of a different format. Assigning contributions to sessions can be performed in two different ways, manually or automatically. Manual assignment This procedure is recommended in particular for Invited Oral presentations, given the small amount of contributions to manage. Go to Organization > Contributions . Work down the list of contributions and for each one open the \" Session \" pop-up menu to select the session where the contribution will be presented. You may want to filter the contributions not yet assigned to any session. Automatic assignment This fits better for contributed orals and posters, since at the time of opening the contributed abstracts submission the programme, hence the sessions, would be defined. The trick is to modify all the tracks and specify a default session for each one. Whenever an abstract will be accepted for a track, the resulting contribution will be automatically assigned to the designated session. Scheduling a contribution from a Session into a Session Block To schedule the contributions in the sessions, return to the Timetable > Blocks screen and click on each session block and then on Go to session block timetable : In the next screen click on Add new contribution (or Poster , for poster sessions): The contributions previously scheduled into the Sessions are shown. Select the contribution(s) and click on Add selected : Once all contributions have been scheduled click within each Session block to see its contents: Manually assigning programme codes to contributions To manually assign programme codes, click on each contribution and on the pen icon to edit: Scroll down to Advanced: Enter the full programme code. Once the Blocks and Sessions have been created and contribution, individual programme codes entered as described above, go to Organisation / Contributions. This screen shows all of the scheduled contributions: Once the Blocks and Sessions have been created and contribution, individual programme codes entered as described above, go to Organisation > Contributions . This screen shows all of the scheduled contributions: It is also possible to add programme codes via the pen icon in the individual contributions listed in this screen, which to some people may be more confortable to use than the Session Block timetable - preferences may vary. Manual assignment of programme codes in bulk The procedure proposed here above walks through editing every contribution and entering their individual programme codes. To speed up the process it is possible to assign programme codes to multiple contributions at once in one single screen. To do this start from the Organisation > Contributions screen as above. Filter the contributions at your will, then select multiple contributions via the checkboxes to their right. It is also possible to select all the filtered contributions via the checkbox to the right of the \" + New Contribution \" button: Now press the Assign programme codes button to enter the multiple assignment screen: As you can see this screen presents the \" New code \" fields pre-filled with some data and suggest to review this codes by manually editing them. This is the result of the Programme Code Templates setting discussed below. Programme Code Templates Programme codes can be generated in a semi-automatic way by using the Programme Code Templates screen reachable from the Advanced options > Programme Codes admin menu: You can see that it is possible to edit four templates: Sessions Session blocks Contributions Subcontributions The idea here is to create a template based on placeholders like {session_code} or {weekday2} . This is explained in the Programme code templates edit screen, reachable by clicking on the pencil icon in the screen above: What we are interested in here is the Contributions template. However, before getting there let's consider the Session blocks template. When we created all the sessions we entered their session code manually. To avoid doing the same again for every session block, you can define the Session blocks template as {session_code} . Then, by clicking the \"play\" icon present to the right of the Session blocks template seen in the Programme Code Templates screen above, all the session blocks' programme codes will be populated by copying the code of the session they are part of. Similarly, you may want to define the Contributions template as {session_block_code} at least. Remember to save these settings. Important note: be aware NOT to use the \"play\" icon for automatic assignment of programme codes for contributions . If used, this would remove all the already assigned programme codes and reset them according to the template, which does not contain all the necessary data IPAC conferences need. For example, with this system it is not possible to assign a sequential ID in the programme code - the id placeholder refers to the numeric abstract id and is not suitable for us.

To create sessions for the conference go to the screen Organisation > Sessions and click on \" Add new session \". This screen has a required field for the title, and a default contribution duration. While none of the other fields are required (session code, description, type of session, location, colour), the Session code field will identify the session in the Book of Abstracts . Therefore, check the default contribution duration is correct , ensure the type of session/presentation is correct , and add a location by de-selecting \"Use default\" and entering a location. Continue creating the sessions for the whole conference. Hint : Enter the session code before the title of the session in the title field, because the session code is not included in the session information when scheduling sessions into the session blocks. It will be easier to identify a session code rather than the title or description of the session when there may be several sessions with the same title (invited oral presentations in MC1... when there are several sessions devoted to invited orals in MC1 during the conference). The sessions screen as it is populated will look like as shown below.

A Session Block is (one part of) a session with a date, a starting time and a duration, plus optional Conveners (chairpersons), a (possibly different) location and programme code. Indico then permits to split one session into multiple blocks: the result is that it is possible to have different times and/or locations for a session. Normally this is never the case for JACoW conferences , hence we here assume a relationship 1 to 1 between sessions and blocks . For this reason one Session Block's Programme Code will be identical to its Session Code. To create \"Blocks\" you need to go to the Timetable screen. Select the wanted day and click on \" Add new \"... \" Session block \" to add the blocks and insert the Sessions from those previously created. Below you can see the session code entered in the session title field to facilitate identification: You don't need to give a name to the Session Block, even more for the reason that one session will have only one block, as explained above.

Since Indico does not allow for several abstract submission exercises, the submission of proposals for invited oral presentations is managed outside of the general abstract submission setup. Prior to opening for the submission of proposals for invited oral presentations it is necessary to populate several of the screens in the JACoW-Indico Event: Organization / Roles Setup Organization / Contributions / Settings Organization / Programme Workflows / Call for Abstracts Organization / Roles Setup The Event Administrator creates the Roles for the different actors who will participate in the organization of the conference. This is done via the Organization / Roles Setup Screen in the Management Area of the event. The initial Roles required for the submission of proposals for invited oral presentations will normally be the OC/SPC/SAB. The following non-exhaustive list gives an idea of which Roles will be entered as the organization of the event advances: LOC/SPC/OC Chair LOC/SPC/OC Member SAB Member Scientific Secretariat Editor-in-Chief IT Manager Industrial Exhibition Manager Registration Manager Author Reception Proceedings Office Editor QA Editor Transparency Processing Editor Indico automatically creates Speaker, Author, Co-author, Reviewer, Convener and Participant roles, etc. as abstracts/contributions are created and reviewed, and delegates register to attend. Indico is a multipurpose generic tool. It is necessary to customise widely. For instance, Indico allows several speakers/submitters per contribution. It is necessary to ensure that the Speakers interface reflects the needs of the particular conference. Note that \"Authors\" are generally the primary/submitting authors and speakers with permissions concerning upload of material. Co-authors normally have no permissions except to see the contribution when logging into Indico. To enter Roles, click on the + Add Role icon and enter the roles with codes. They can be colour coded. Against each Role the Conference Administrator will enter the names of the persons in each role. Click on the outlined box and + Add User to search for the persons concerned. All persons entered via this screen are visible in the Organization / Participant Roles screen. This screen is discussed later. To send one e-mail to several roles, use the Organization / Participant Roles interface. An e-mail archive is to be found in the Management Area under Reports / Logs. The Roles Setup screen thus allows the Event Administrator to create the roles, and enter the names of the persons in those roles. Important notes on Permissions At this stage we are preparing for submission of proposals for invited oral presentations: this means that the numer of people that need access to the Indico event is relatively small. Only the Scientific Secretariat, the Organising Committee, the Scientific Programme Committee and the Scientific Advisory Board need to login and operate in this event . In other words, you don't want any free access to the event details. For this reason, we recommend that you set the event as Protected under the Protection section of the Admin interface . You also want to add Access Permissions to the Roles created above, otherwise they won't be able to login and submit proposals. This settting will also prevent proposed authors for inadvertently discover their names in any submitted abstract before time in case they logged in to this event. Organization / Contributions / Settings For the submission of proposals for invited oral presentations it is necessary to set the type of contribution that will appear for selection in the Abstract Submission Form. To create Contribution types, click on the Contributions, and then the Settings link: Click on Contribution types and + New contribution type to enter them. The Add new contribution type screen allows to enter the Name of the type, and a description. The new contribution type can be set to \" Private \" so it can not be chosen by users submitting an abstract : In the example below are the most usual contribution types. Once entered one can \"Manage contribution types\". They can be modified, made private, public, or deleted. In connection with the submission of proposals for invited oral proposals, those making proposals should see only the contribution type \"Invited Oral Presentation\". To achieve this ensure that all except Invited Oral Presentation are Private . Via the Contributions screen it is also possible to create contributions, i.e. presentations that are submitted outside of the general submission procedure, where no review procedure/acceptance is required. An example might be opening or closing remarks, etc. For the submission of invited oral presentations, click on the pen icon for Invited Oral Presentation and in the Edit contribution type screen ensure the radio button is unchecked. If it is active, the contribution type will not be visible to submitters: All other contribution types should remain Private. The Manage Screen now shows the Invited Oral Presentation type is not private: Organization / Programme This screen allows the entry of Track Groups (known in SPMS as Main Classifications) and Tracks (known in SPMS as Sub-classifications). For the submission of proposals for invited orals, only Track Groups are normally offered to submitters to facilitate rapid creation of proposals. However, since Indico normally works on the basis of Tracks, and review is via Tracks, and there is no combination of Track Group/Track as known in SPMS, it is simpler to enter the Track Groups (Main Classification) in the Tracks fields. SPC members will then see something like this when submitting proposals: Note that when it will be time for general abstract submission it will be necessary to re-work the Track Groups/Tracks to propose a more refined grouping. The combination of Track Groups and Tracks (in SPMS Main and Sub-classifications) makes it far easier for submitters to decide the precise place their contribution should appear in the programme, and for the Event Administrator to schedule them. Workflows / Call for Abstracts First of all this module needs to be enable by clicking the \" Enable module \" button. The submission form is configured via the link to Submission / Settings . Click on Fields and types to configure contribution types and abstract fields. Submission / Settings Announcement In the field \"Announcement\" it is possible to enter a statement concerning abstract submission. This appears in the link to Call for Abstracts in the Home Page Menu, above the link to Submit New Abstract: call4abstracts-announcement.png Multiple Tracks While Indico offers the possibility for submitters to select several tracks, this possibility was dropped by most JACoW events many years ago with the introduction of the combination of Track Group/Track, which provides the fine tuning necessary for optimum scheduling of contributions within the programme. This option should NOT be set . Require tracks IPAC proposals for invited oral presentations are normally submitted with only the Track Group (Main Classification) option to simplify the job for the proposers. Since only Tracks, and not Track Groups, may be selected in Indico (even if they are associated with a Track Group), it is necessary to imagine a workaround for the submission of proposals for invited oral presentations. It is thus proposed to enter the Track Groups (Main Classifications) in the Tracks (Sub-classifications) table, such that proposers see only the Track Groups (Main Classifications). As mentioned above, the Track Groups entered in the Tracks fields will need to be re-worked following the exercise of selecting the invited oral presentations, prior to opening for general abstract submission. This option should be set. Require contribution type For the submission of proposals for invited oral presentations, this button should be set to Require a contribution type. As explained above, the only one visible will be Invited Oral Presentation . Allow attachments JACoW events do not normally allow attachments at the level of abstract submission. Leave this option unset . Allow speakers In the exercise of proposing invited oral presentations, the submitter should NOT be the speaker, whereas in normal abstract submission the abstract submitter would be the speaker/primary author by default, and be able to identify an alternative speaker/primary author as well as co-authors. The Event Administrator should thus explain clearly to proposers how to enter speakers when submitting proposals. This option should be set. Require a speaker This parameter makes the entry of at least one speaker a required field. For proposals for invited oral presentations submitters may normally enter a number of possible speakers. In the general abstract submission/call for abstracts, the primary author should by default be the Speaker/Presenter. This option should be set . Allow editing For the submission of proposals for invited orals, leave the default \"Abstract submitter only\". Contribution submitters The text states: Specify who will get contribution submission rights once an abstract has been accepted, and the choice of Speakers or Speakers and Authors. It is necessary to recall that in Indico, an Abstract becomes a Contribution once it has been approved for presentation. We suggest to choose \" Speakers and authors \". Authorized submitters For the submission of proposals for invited orals, and the need to work outside of the normal abstract submission procedure, enter here the names of all of the persons who are \"Authorized Submitters\" of proposals for invited oral presentations. Click on Event Role and add SPC Member, OC Member, SAB etc. , or click on User to search and enter persons without a specific role. These persons will see the possibility to submit abstracts in the event home page even if the general abstract submission is closed. Instructions The instructions here will be displayed above the abstract submission form. It should be used for precise instructions, for example concerning the Footnotes field. At the level of proposals for invited orals it might be used for more precise instructions to the submitters, for example concerning how to enter proposals for speakers. Fields and types / Contribution Types - Abstract Fields Contribution types may be entered via this interface, or via the Organization / Contributions screen, as per instructions above . Extra fields for the abstract submission form may be created via the Abstract Fields interface if they are not included in the \"default\" list.

The ratio of the invited orals vs. contributed orals is decided by the Committee responsible for the scientific programme (for IPAC: SPC, for HB: IOC, etc.). For IPAC, and several other JACoW conference series, there is a call for proposals for invited oral presentations approx. 15 months prior to the conference \u2013 the aim being to have a complete programme of invited orals , the backbone of the conference programme, when the conference website goes online around 9 or 10 months in advance of the event. The persons contacted for proposals are normally members of the Organizing Committee (OC), the Scientific Programme Committee (SPC), and the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), though persons outside of these bodies may also be called upon to submit. All of them need to have JACOW profiles and must have the necessary privileges. The number of persons concerned for IPAC is in the region of 120 . The number of proposals averages around 400 . It is wise to invite speakers a year in advance since many have full agendas. The IPAC SPC normally meets at the so called SPC/2 meeting just over a year in advance of the conference to decide the look and feel of the event, the overall schedule, and the invited orals (ensuring swift invitations). The Track Groups and Tracks (Main and Sub-classifications) are generally also reviewed at this meeting. Normal IPAC workflow The IPAC workflow of the submission of proposals for Invited Oral Presentations is as follows: SAB/OC/SPC members enter proposals into Indico via their own profiles. Proposals consist of a title, a brief description of what the talk should cover, one or more candidates as proposed speakers and a Main Classification; SPC members review the Main Classification assignments of all proposed abstracts; SPC MC Coordinators accept/reject requests of classification changes from previous step; SPC members review all proposals by assigning priorities/scores prior to the SPC/2 meeting; SPC MC Coordinators confer with their \"shadows\" or \"deputies\" to tag their priorities (1, 2nd and 3rd) to produce a preliminary list of preferred invited oral presentations and reserves; at the SPC/2 meeting, the Session Coordinators announce their proposals (talks and schedule within the synoptic table) to the full SPC for discussion, with the aim to ultimately ensure the best possible overall programme, eliminating overlap in content, avoiding clashes, ensuring good geographical and gender balance.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"InvitedOrals/intro/#submission-of-proposals-for-invited-oral-presentations","text":"","title":"Submission of Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations"},{"location":"InvitedOrals/intro/#introduction","text":"Conference programmes are generally composed of three types of presentation: Invited Oral , Contributed Oral and Poster .

Depending on your conference you may also want to activate one or several of the others. The alternative for collecting other files without passing them through a review process, is to use the standard Indico Material Submission process. In order to activate one or several editing workflows, go to the Editing module, then activate the toggle right of the List of editable types . Activate the toggle right of each type for which you want to activate the editing workflow, then Save . The display then switches back to the list of activated workflows. Click on the Manage button of the desired editing workflow in order to configure it (see following sections). Configuring the File Types One of the key instruments in ensuring the quality of submitted material in JACoW conferences is the possibility to limit users with regards to the type of files they submit and how they name them. This makes things more predictable so that further workflows (human and automated) can process the data accordingly and usually helps avoiding mistakes. This is handled through File Types which can be seen as folders into which submitters upload their editable files. Specific File Types can be set for each editing process (so independently for papers, slides and posters). In order to configure your File Types for a given editing process, click on the Configure button in the File types section. You can then add new File Types, edit or delete existing ones. For each File Type, the following fields can be configured: Name - which will be displayed on the interface; File name template - the format which the name of the file to be uploaded should follow; this will be enforced when the user will submit the editable files; the template can include the {code} placeholder which will be replaced by the contribution programme code Extensions - allowed file extensions for that file type; File required - whether the file type is mandatory (at least one file required); Multiple files - whether the file type allows for more than one file; Publishable - whether the contents of the type should be displayed publicly once the editable is published.

Judging Judging is the way an editor assesses an editable according to the Editing States , in paricular Accept (it's OK, Green ), Make changes (the editor made changes which need acceptance, Yellow ) or Request changes (to the author, Red ). Only the editor assigned to the editable can assign a judgment. It is accessible at the bottom of the timeline, through the Judge button. It gives access to 4 options: Accept Reject (not normally used by JACoW conferences) Make changes Request changes Accept (GREEN) Choose this option when the editable is ready for publishing. This will move the editable to the \"Accepted\" status, and notify the author by email. This is nearly the end of the editing process (the editable needs to pass a final QA process before being fully publishable) Reject (BLACK) Choose this option when the editable is simply rejected for publishing. It will move the editable to the Rejected status and notify the author by email. JACoW conferences normally do not use to reject any paper . Instead, the contibution can be withdrawn. Make Changes (YELLOW) Choose this option when you have made some changes to the editable files yourself. You can upload the new files in the dialog which opens up.

Beware you must also submit a comment and, eventually, some tags (error codes,) or the \"Confirm\" button will not be activated.
