# Uploading a new version of the files

At some point in the editing process, the editor may ask you to do some 
changes on the uploaded files. You are warned by email when such a 
request is made, and the status of your contribution turns to “Needs 
Changes”. In this case a new upload form will appear at the bottom of 
the timeline:

Editors can also assign error tags to the request for change which then appear as colored tags on the timeline.
